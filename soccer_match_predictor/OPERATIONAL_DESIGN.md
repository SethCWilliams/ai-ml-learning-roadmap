# Soccer Match Predictor - Operational Design

## Overview
A daily-scheduled prediction system that adapts to real-world data availability, providing initial predictions and refining them as more information becomes available.

## Operational Flow

### Daily Schedule (Example: 9:00 AM UTC)

```
09:00 - Daily Check
├── Get today's fixtures (ESPN API)
├── If no matches → Sleep until tomorrow
└── If matches found → Initialize prediction pipeline
```

### Match Day Pipeline

#### Phase 1: Initial Prediction (Morning - 9:00 AM)
**Available Data:**
- ✅ Team records and league position
- ✅ Home/away performance history  
- ✅ Current form (last 5 games)
- ✅ Historical head-to-head
- ❌ Starting lineups (not released)
- ❌ Latest injury news

**Actions:**
1. Scrape FBref for updated team stats
2. Get recent results from ESPN API
3. Generate **Base Prediction** with confidence interval
4. Store prediction with timestamp
5. Set up monitoring for updates

**ML Learning Point:** How models perform with incomplete data

#### Phase 2: Injury & News Updates (Throughout Day)
**Schedule:** Every 2 hours from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM
**Available Data:**
- ✅ All Phase 1 data
- ⚠️ Injury reports (ESPN news, team announcements)
- ⚠️ Press conference updates

**Actions:**
1. Check ESPN news endpoint for injury updates
2. Update injury impact features if significant news
3. Regenerate prediction if major changes detected
4. Track prediction confidence changes

**ML Learning Point:** Feature importance and model sensitivity

#### Phase 3: Pre-Match Final Update (45 minutes before kickoff)
**Available Data:**
- ✅ All previous data
- ✅ Starting lineups (ESPN/official sources)
- ✅ Latest injury confirmations
- ✅ Weather conditions
- ✅ Last-minute team news

**Actions:**
1. Get official starting lineups
2. Calculate lineup strength features
3. Update weather-related features
4. Generate **Final Prediction** with highest confidence
5. Compare with initial prediction
6. Store complete prediction history

**ML Learning Point:** Model improvement with complete data

## Prediction Versioning System

### Prediction Types
```python
class PredictionType(Enum):
    INITIAL = "initial_9am"      # Base team data only
    UPDATED = "injury_update"    # With injury information  
    FINAL = "pre_match_45min"    # All available data
```

### Confidence Scoring
- **Initial (60-70% confidence):** Team stats + form only
- **Updated (70-80% confidence):** + injury information
- **Final (80-90% confidence):** + lineups + weather

### Data Availability Matrix

| Feature | 9 AM | Updates | 45 Min Before |
|---------|------|---------|---------------|
| Team Records | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Form (L5) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Home/Away Splits | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| League Position | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Injury Reports | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Starting Lineups | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Weather | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Formation | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Scheduler Service
```python
class MatchDayScheduler:
    def run_daily_check(self):
        matches = self.get_todays_matches()
        if not matches:
            self.sleep_until_tomorrow()
        else:
            self.initialize_match_day_pipeline(matches)
    
    def schedule_updates(self, matches):
        # Schedule injury updates every 2 hours
        # Schedule final update 45 min before each match
```

### 2. Prediction Engine
```python
class PredictionEngine:
    def generate_initial_prediction(self, match_data):
        # Use base team features only
        confidence = self.calculate_confidence("initial")
        return Prediction(
            match_id=match_data.id,
            type=PredictionType.INITIAL,
            confidence=confidence,
            features_used=self.get_available_features()
        )
    
    def update_prediction(self, match_id, new_data):
        # Incorporate injury/lineup data
        # Compare with previous prediction
        # Update confidence score
```

### 3. Data Availability Handler
```python
class DataAvailabilityManager:
    def get_feature_completeness(self, match_time):
        # Calculate what percentage of features are available
        # Adjust model confidence accordingly
        
    def handle_missing_data(self, features):
        # Use team averages for missing lineup data
        # Flag uncertain predictions
```

## Learning Opportunities

### ML Concepts Demonstrated

#### 1. Model Confidence & Uncertainty
- **Early predictions:** Higher uncertainty, wider confidence intervals
- **Final predictions:** Lower uncertainty, narrower intervals
- **Feature importance:** Which new data changes predictions most?

#### 2. Real-World Data Challenges
- **Missing data handling:** How to predict without complete information
- **Data freshness:** Balancing update frequency vs API limits
- **Temporal dependencies:** How recent information affects older data

#### 3. Production ML Systems
- **Model versioning:** Tracking prediction changes over time
- **A/B testing:** Comparing early vs final prediction accuracy
- **Monitoring:** Detecting when models need updates

### Analysis Questions to Explore
1. **How much does lineup information improve accuracy?**
2. **Which injuries have the biggest prediction impact?**
3. **Do early or final predictions perform better long-term?**
4. **What's the optimal update frequency for injury checks?**
