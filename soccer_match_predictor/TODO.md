## Immediate Next Steps (High Priority)

### 🏗️ Foundation Setup
- [ ] Install Poetry dependencies (`poetry install`)
- [ ] Set up `.env` file with API keys
- [ ] Test basic project structure
- [ ] Create first Jupyter notebook for exploration

### 📊 Data Collection (Phase 1)
- [ ] **ESPN API Integration**
  - [ ] Research ESPN API endpoints for Premier League
  - [ ] Research ESPN API endpoints for MLS  
  - [ ] Build basic API client with rate limiting
  - [ ] Test data retrieval and structure

- [ ] **FBref Scraping Setup**
  - [ ] Analyze FBref page structure for team stats
  - [ ] Build respectful scraper with delays
  - [ ] Focus on key stats: xG, possession, shots, etc.
  - [ ] Create data validation and cleaning pipeline

- [ ] **Data Storage**
  - [ ] Design SQLite schema for match data
  - [ ] Implement caching strategy
  - [ ] Create data update/refresh mechanisms

### 🧪 Initial Exploration
- [ ] **Data Analysis Notebook**
  - [ ] Load and explore first dataset
  - [ ] Visualize team performance patterns
  - [ ] Analyze home advantage effects
  - [ ] Compare Premier League vs MLS characteristics

## Medium Priority

### 🔧 Feature Engineering
- [ ] Team form calculations (last 5, 10 games)
- [ ] Goal difference trends
