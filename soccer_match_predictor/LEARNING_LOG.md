# Soccer Match Predictor - Learning Log

## Overview
This document tracks my learning journey through building a soccer match predictor. The focus is on understanding ML concepts deeply, not just building a working model.

## Key Learning Areas

### 1. Data Collection & Engineering
**Concepts to Master:**
- [ ] Web scraping best practices and ethics
- [ ] API rate limiting and data management
- [ ] Time-series data handling in sports
- [ ] Feature engineering for categorical and numerical data
- [ ] Data quality assessment and cleaning

**Notes:**
- Starting with ESPN API (free) + FBref scraping
- Need to understand seasonality effects in soccer data
- Important: Handle missing data thoughtfully

### 2. Machine Learning Fundamentals
**Concepts to Master:**
- [ ] Supervised learning classification
- [ ] Train/validation/test splits for time-series data
- [ ] Cross-validation strategies for sports data
- [ ] Handling class imbalance (draws are less common)
- [ ] Feature selection and importance

**Algorithm Deep Dives:**
- [ ] **Random Forest:** Why ensemble methods work, how trees make decisions
- [ ] **XGBoost:** Gradient boosting concept, why it's effective for tabular data
- [ ] **Logistic Regression:** Linear baseline, interpretability vs complexity trade-offs

### 3. Model Evaluation & Interpretation
**Concepts to Master:**
- [ ] Accuracy vs precision/recall in sports prediction
- [ ] ROC curves and AUC interpretation
- [ ] SHAP values for model explanation
- [ ] Feature importance analysis
- [ ] Avoiding overfitting with temporal data

### 4. Sports Analytics Specific
**Domain Knowledge:**
- [ ] Home advantage quantification
- [ ] Form vs class in team performance
- [ ] Weather impact on gameplay
- [ ] Head-to-head statistics relevance
- [ ] League differences (Premier League vs MLS)

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Data Foundation ⏳
- [x] Project setup and structure
- [ ] ESPN API integration
- [ ] FBref scraper development
- [ ] Data storage and caching strategy
- [ ] Initial data exploration

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering ⏳
- [ ] Team form calculations (last 5 games, etc.)
- [ ] Home/away performance splits
- [ ] Head-to-head historical analysis
- [ ] Weather data integration
- [ ] Advanced metrics (xG, possession, etc.)

### Phase 3: Model Development ⏳
- [ ] Baseline models (simple heuristics)
- [ ] Random Forest implementation with explanations
- [ ] XGBoost tuning and comparison
- [ ] Ensemble combination strategies
- [ ] Model validation and testing

### Phase 4: Analysis & Insights ⏳
- [ ] Feature importance analysis
- [ ] League-specific model differences
- [ ] Prediction confidence intervals
- [ ] Error analysis and improvement strategies
- [ ] SHAP-based explanations

## Questions & Insights

### Data Questions
- How far back should historical data go for relevance?
- What's the optimal balance between team-level and player-level features?
- How to handle transfers and squad changes?

### Model Questions  
- Should Premier League and MLS have separate models?
- How to handle the three-class problem (Win/Draw/Loss)?
- What's more valuable: accuracy or interpretability?

### Learning Insights
*(To be filled as I progress)*
