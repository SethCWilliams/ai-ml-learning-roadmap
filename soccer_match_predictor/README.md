## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Choose one)

### One-Command Setup
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/setup.sh | bash
```

### Manual Setup (Poetry - Recommended)
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd soccer_match_predictor
make setup
poetry shell
make run
```

### Manual Setup (Pip)
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd soccer_match_predictor
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
python src/main.py
```

### Web Interface
```bash
make run-web
# Opens Streamlit app at http://localhost:8501
```

## ðŸ“– Learning Context

This is part of my AI/ML learning roadmap focusing on:
- **Data collection** from APIs and web scraping
- **Feature engineering** for sports prediction
- **Supervised learning** with ensemble methods
- **Model evaluation** and explanation techniques

**Leagues:** Premier League and MLS  
**Focus:** Learning ML concepts through detailed explanations, not just prediction accuracy

## ðŸ›  Development

### Available Commands
```bash
make install          # Install dependencies
make setup            # Full project setup
make run              # Run CLI predictor
make run-web          # Launch Streamlit app
make test             # Run tests
